Ambrosia Apple (Malus 'Ambrosia') plants require regular watering, especially during the flowering and fruiting season. Generally, they require 1-2 inches of water per week (including rainfall). If the soil is allowed to become too dry, the plant's growth and fruit production can be affected. During the spring and summer months, it is important to water your Ambrosia Apple deeply and thoroughly, at least twice a week. Once established, the plant is highly drought tolerant and will require less watering during fall and winter.
